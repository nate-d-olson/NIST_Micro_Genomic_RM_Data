# NIST Microbial Genomic RM Data
Supplemental data and files for NIST microbial genomic reference materials (RM 8375, 8376, 8377, and 8378).  Data includes raw and cropped PFGE gel image files from the DNA stability study and optical mapping results.  Supplemental files include the reference genome sequences and configuration file used to run the PEPR bioinformatics pipeline.

## Reference Genomes
The reference genome sequences are the initial genome sequence for the reference materials.  A _de-novo_ assembly using Pacific Biosciences long read data was first generated and the assembly was validated using optical mapping and short read sequencing data then characterized using short read sequencing data using the PEPR bioinformatic pipeline (https://github.com/usnistgov/pepr, https://github.com/usnistgov/peprr). The yaml configuration files in this repository can be used to rerun the genome characterization and evaluation procedure.
