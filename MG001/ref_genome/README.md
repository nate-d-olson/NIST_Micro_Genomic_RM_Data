## RM8375-MG001 Reference Genome Version History
### v0.001
_De novo_ assembly of Pacific Biosciences RSII sequencing data (SRR1425899, SRR1425900, SRR1425901) using the HGAP assembly algorithm.

* Ambiguity in genome assembly based on the comparison of PacBio assembly and optical mapping data.

### v0.002
Changes made to v0.001 by Pilon V?? using Illumina MiSeq data (SRR1555296-SRR1555311)

### v1.00
Re-running Pilon V with Illumina MiSeq data identified an additional SNP.
